Welcome to the official Github repository for Praction - an organization dedicated to learning and having fun as we go.

## About Praction

Praction is a community-driven organization focused on learning and exploration. We are a group of individuals who are passionate about technology, coding, and innovation. Our goal is to create an environment that fosters creativity, collaboration, and growth.

## Our Approach

We don't offer any services or products. Our main objective is to learn and have fun as we go. We encourage all members to experiment with new technologies, contribute to open-source projects, and engage in coding challenges.

## Work Opportunities

While we are primarily focused on learning and experimentation, we may be interested in taking on some work from time to time. However, please note that there is a big chance that we may deny your offer. Our primary focus is on our members and creating an environment that fosters learning and growth.
